# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera
### [Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

This is my personal projects for the course. The course covers deep learning from begginer level to advanced. Highly recommend anyone wanting to break into AI. 

Instructor: [Andrew Ng, DeepLearning.ai]()
